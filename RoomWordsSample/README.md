## RoomWordsSample

The RoomWordsSample app does the following:
<ul>
<li>Works with a database to get and save words, and pre-populates the database with some words.</li>
<li>Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.</li>
<li>Opens a second Activity when the user taps the + FAB button. When the user enters a word, the app adds the word to the database and then the list updates automatically.</li>
</ul>
